          Rework of the land mass started yesterday.  It wasnt looking right, and i have adjusted river position.
          I should have used the proportional reposition, but i didnt so it took a bit longer.

          started to add some buildings, i like the ones i did earlier, they are not bad, but not what i want.  
          The will be place holders until i get something better.
