        <p>It took me the better part of the day to get the base structure of the website up and running.  I tried some pieces that few others had suggested, jekyll and hugo, I dislike the static building tools, they call it compile, but it is translation from there human readable words to another set of human readable words.  I may not have given it enough of a chance, ut seems like to much effort.</p>
        <p>In the end i went with Bootstrap for the base css and some layout.  I grabbed a free template and hacked away teh parts i didnt like.  I then added handlerbars to get some templates in and added data into a json file.  This allows the sight be a single page html site, with a the data being ust a simple json file, and each post being a "template" html file that can be pulled in when needed.</p>
        <p>There are still a few things that need to be done, but it is easy to maintain for now.</p>
