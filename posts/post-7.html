          Lots to cover, work was busy, life was busy, so this blog took a back seat for a bit.
          So I found that all of my buildings even though I liked them had a vertice count tah twas too high for what I want to do.
          So I cleaned up what I could, but wound up creating many more hovels/farms areas.
          I added in a few more trees, windmills, a blacksmithy, a shop, fences, gates, walk ways.  Like I said lots of stuff.
          This is a screen shot of the Farm village.

          The world is broken down into a 4x4 grid, 16 total areas, only 7 of which are under water.

          Right now I am working to complete A-4 this is where one of the Farms will be.
