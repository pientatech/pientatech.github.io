          I had a reoccurance of a fbx import issue.  I thought i had taken care of it a while back but it returned.
          the problem was simple to solve as it was just setting "FBX Unit Scale" for Apply Scalling and checking the 
          "apply transform".  This resolved the issue, but it required me to reimport everything adn redo all prefabs.
          This took a bit but it was not to bad at this point in the process.
