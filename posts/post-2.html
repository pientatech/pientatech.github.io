        <p>I started working on the game a few months ago, the idea is simple.  Build a turn based RPG old school style.</p>
        <p>Things i want in teh game are: perma-death, no explaination of the world - except through in game play, no explaination of the controls for the game, dont explain how anything works.</p>
        <p>There will be saved games, but if your character dies, they are dead, i would like to find a way to enforce this taht is simple.  but i may need to have the data stroed in the "cloud".</p>
        <p>I was worried about the 3d meshes, as i am not an artist, but that is prooving to not be that difficult.  I will add some srticles on the different pieces later.</p>
        <p>I do need to get a task lisk put together on teh pieces I need to make still so that is below :)</p>
